This parallel version is basically identical to the serial. 
The only difference is the way to run the inversion. We provided an example of submission script 
tested on the Legion cluster (University College London, UK). 
Different clusters will probably need different submission script but you can use our example as a 
template.

We also provide a slightly different routine to plot the results. 
If python2.7 with matplotlib is installed in your cluster you can plot the results directly there.
Otherwise you can download locally the results and plotting it with the serial version of 
the plot_results.py routine

Prerequisites
--------------------------------------------------------------------
- gfortran or ifort (we used ifort) 
- cc compiler
- python 2.7
- matplotlib 2.1.2



Preparation and compilation
--------------------------------------------------------------------
- Install Computer Programs in Seismology:
	>  cd to NA/src/hv_subs/PROGRAMS.330/ and type:
	>  ./Setup
	>  Select from the list the best configuration for your machine (in our case LINUX6440)
	>  ./Setup LINUX6440
	>  ./C
	>  Add the path to export PROGRAMS.330/bin to your .bashrc file 
		(export PATH=<path>/Inversion/serial/NA/src/hv_subs/PROGRAMS.330/bin:$PATH)

	For other information about the installation please refer to the detailed guide CPSInstall.pdf in PROGRAMS.330 		folder

- Compile the Neighbourhood Algorithm routines:
	>  cd to NA/src
	>  Edit the file "makena macros" setting your fortran and C compilers. "Type" variable has to be set to "mpi"
	>  make clean
	>  make all

	>  If everything is ok you will get the message: "make all (MPI version) completed successfully !"
	


Run a demo inversion
--------------------------------------------------------------------
To run a demo inversion please edit the file job_parallel choosing a name for the inversion,
then type:
> qsub job_parallel

wait for your turn in the queue.
To check the status of the queue type
> qstat


When the job will be executed it will recompile the code then run a full inversion. 
Finally it will plot the results, that will be found
in the folder results/<name_of_the_inversion>/

The inversion takes approx 10 minutes time (tested on a cluster with 20 processors).



Known issues (updated 12 December 2018)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
- The NA routine produces a few more models than needed, due to a problem with processors synchronization.
	This still allow a correct inversion, tested extensively with both synthetic and real cases. The only
	problem is that if the number of models sampled should be say 4000, the NA will produce 4020 models, 
	depending on the number of processors used. We are working to fix this problem.
